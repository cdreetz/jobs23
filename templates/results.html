            The scores below represent how closely your skills align with the selected role, represented as a proportion of the jobs that require that skill compared to the total number of job posts for that specific role. A higher score indicates a closer match. Additionally, you can view the top 10 skills most essential for the role to further refine your skill set.
        </p>
        <p class="lead text-center">
            For example, a skill that has a score of 0.60 is a pretty good skill since 60 out of 100 of those jobs require it, but a skill with a score of 0.02 means that only 2 out of every 100 of the jobs ask for the skill so it's probably not that important.
